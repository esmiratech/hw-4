Create a new repository called “Terraform_Exercises” in github and clone it to your local machine. You will keep track of your terraform exercises (code) in this repo

Create 2 EC2s in the default VPC, inject userdata that installs apache while EC2s are provisioning.
Create a key pair and attach it to your ec2s in order to ssh to your ec2s.


Create 2 security groups, one for EC2s and one for ALB

Create a target group and put EC2s behind it.

=====
resource "aws_lb_target_group" "alb-example" {
  name        = "tf-example-lb-alb-tg"
  port        = 80
  protocol    = "TCP"
}

========

resource "aws_lb_target_group_attachment" "test" {
  target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.test.arn
  target_id        = aws_instance.test.id
  port             = 80
}

========

Create ALB in the same default VPC


Create ALB listeners for 80 and 443 ports. Attach your SSL to ALB. Make sure health check is going through

Create Hosted Zone in AWS (should be done in AWS console). **NOTE: we did it during AWS hands-on. Please use that hosted zone. 

Create Route 53 C-Name to forward the DNS Name of your load balancer to your domain name. 
Test your apache by hitting the URL of your Hosted Zone record name (EX: andrew.chicagotentech.com).
